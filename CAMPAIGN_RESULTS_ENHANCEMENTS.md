# Campaign Results Page Enhancements

## Implemented Changes

We've made significant improvements to the Campaign Results page based on your requirements to focus on prescription impact and ad performance metrics by provider segmentation.

### 1. Restructured Tab Order & Prominence

- Moved **Overview** tab to first position (default view)
- Removed visual "Key" badge from Prescription Impact tab
- Replaced the general "Engagement" tab with a specific "Ad Performance" tab
- Removed the ROI Analysis tab completely
- Reordered tabs for better information hierarchy:
  1. Overview (default tab)
  2. Prescription Impact
  3. Ad Performance

### 2. Provider-Focused Filtering

- Added persistent provider filter controls at the top of the results page:
  - Filter by Specialty (Primary Care, Cardiology, etc.)
  - Filter by Geographic Region
  - Filter by Prescribing Volume (High, Medium, Low)
- These filters apply to all metrics across all tabs

### 3. Enhanced Key Metrics

- Redesigned the metrics panel to highlight key metrics:
  - **Script Lift**: Highlighted with special styling to make it most prominent
  - **Click-Through Rate**: Ad server specific metric
  - **Cost Per Click**: Ad server specific metric 
  - **ROI**: Financial impact

### 4. New Ad Performance Tab

- Completely replaced website-focused "Engagement" tab with ad server metrics
- Created dedicated ad performance visualizations:
  - Ad metrics by channel (Display, Social, Email, Search)
  - Performance trends over time
  - Provider specialty-specific ad performance
  - Regional ad performance breakdown
- Added metrics specific to ad servers:
  - Impressions
  - Clicks
  - CTR (Click-Through Rate)
  - CPC (Cost Per Click)

### 5. Enhanced Prescription Impact Tab

- Kept as the primary tab for analyzing script lift impact
- Continued to feature the ScriptLiftComparison component
- Maintained breakdown of prescriptions by provider specialty

### 6. Provider Information Integration

- Connected provider segments (specialty, geography) with both:
  - Ad performance metrics (impressions, clicks)
  - Prescription impact metrics
- Created visualizations showing performance by:
  - Provider specialty (vertical bar charts)
  - Geographic region (vertical bar charts)

## Technical Implementation

These changes were implemented by:

1. Restructuring the tab order in CampaignResults.tsx
2. Adding provider filtering controls
3. Updating key metrics to focus on prescription impact and ad performance
4. Creating a new Ad Performance tab with ad server-specific metrics
5. Enhancing visualizations to show metrics by provider segments
6. Adding visual emphasis to the Prescription Impact tab

## Result

The updated Campaign Results page now:

- Makes prescription impact the most prominent feature
