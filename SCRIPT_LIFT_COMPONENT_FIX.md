# Script Lift Component Fix

## Overview

This document details the improvements made to the ScriptLiftComparison component to address issues with the prescription impact analysis screen. The primary problems were that the component wasn't properly displaying the target medication that was set during campaign creation and needed UI clarifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Target Medication Banner

Added a prominent banner at the top of the component that:
- Clearly displays which medication is the target for the campaign
- Shows an error message if no target medication was found
- Provides context that this medication was set during campaign creation

```jsx
{/* Target Medication Banner */}
<div className="mb-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 border border-blue-100 rounded-lg">
  <div className="flex items-center">
    <Pill className="h-5 w-5 text-blue-600 mr-2" />
    <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-800">Campaign Target Medication</h4>
  </div>
  
  {medicationOptions.some(med => med.isTarget) ? (
    <div className="mt-2">
      <div className="font-medium text-gray-900">
        {medicationOptions.find(med => med.isTarget)?.name || 'Unknown Medication'}
      </div>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">
        This medication was set as the target when the campaign was created and is being tracked for script lift.
      </p>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <div className="mt-2 text-amber-700">
      <p>No target medication found for this campaign. Target medication should be set during campaign creation.</p>
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

### 2. Improved Campaign Data Fetching

- Modified the data loading logic to fetch campaign details first
- Added code to explicitly identify and store the target medication ID from the campaign data
- Set an intermediate loading state for the target medication while data is being fetched

```javascript
// Fetch campaign details to get target medication ID
const { data: campaignData, error: campaignError } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', effectiveCampaignId)
  .single();

// Store the target medication ID from the campaign
const campaignTargetMedId = campaignData.target_medication_id;

// Set the target medication info for display
if (campaignTargetMedId) {
  setTargetMedicationInfo({ id: campaignTargetMedId, name: 'Loading...' });
} else {
  console.warn('No target medication ID found in campaign data');
  setTargetMedicationInfo(null);
}
```

### 3. Updated Button Text and UI

- Changed "Set as Target" button to "Update View Settings" to accurately reflect its function
- Fixed loading state animation for the button
- Added proper feedback messaging when settings are saved

```jsx
<Button 
  onClick={saveMedicationSelections}
  disabled={isSavingConfig || !primaryMedication}
  size="sm"
  className="mt-auto ml-2"
>
  {isSavingConfig ? (
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <div className="animate-spin h-4 w-4 mr-1.5 border-2 border-white border-t-transparent rounded-full"></div>
      <span className="text-sm">Saving...</span>
    </div>
  ) : saveSuccess ? (
    <div className="flex items-center text-green-600">
      <span className="text-sm">Saved</span>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <Save className="h-4 w-4 mr-1.5" />
      <span className="text-sm">Update View Settings</span>
    </div>
  )}
</Button>
```

## Benefits

- **Improved Clarity**: Users can now clearly see which medication was set as the target for script lift analysis
- **Better Onboarding**: The component now explains that the target medication is set during campaign creation
- **Enhanced User Feedback**: Loading states and success messages provide better feedback
- **More Accurate UI**: Button text now accurately reflects its function

## Technical Details

The implementation fetches the campaign details at the start of the data loading process to retrieve the target medication ID. It then uses this information to:

1. Initialize the `targetMedicationInfo` state
2. Mark the appropriate medication as the target in the medication options list
3. Default to selecting the target medication in the multi-select
4. Display it prominently in the target medication banner

The component preserves all existing functionality for comparing medications, analyzing by specialty, and viewing competitive data while making the target medication more clearly visible.
