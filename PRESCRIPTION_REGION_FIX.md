# Prescription Data Region Column Fix

This document outlines the changes made to resolve issues with inconsistent column naming in the prescription data tables. We encountered an issue where both `provider_region` and `provider_geographic_area` were being used inconsistently, causing 404 errors when querying the database.

## Problem

Two different column names were being used to store the same data:
- `provider_region` in some queries/code
- `provider_geographic_area` in other parts of the system

This inconsistency led to errors when code tried to access data using the wrong column name.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers to ensure backward and forward compatibility:

1. **Database Schema Fixes**: 
   - The Supabase migration `20250331000000_unified_schema_fix.sql` now ensures both column names exist and are kept in sync using database triggers

2. **Type Definitions**: 
   - Updated `PrescriptionData` interface in `src/types/prescription.ts` to include both field names
   - Added `provider_geographic_area` as an optional field alongside `provider_region`
   - Added a new option to the `PrescriptionGroupBy` type to allow grouping by either field

3. **Helper Function**: 
   - Created `getProviderRegion()` in `prescriptionDataGenerator.ts` to safely handle either column name
   - This function returns `provider_region` if it exists, otherwise falls back to `provider_geographic_area`
   - If neither exists, it returns an empty string to avoid undefined errors

4. **Data Processing**: 
   - Modified `fetchPrescriptionData()` to process returned data and ensure both fields exist
   - Added mapping logic to copy values between fields when only one exists
   - This ensures consistent data regardless of which database column is populated

5. **Grouping Logic**: 
   - Updated `groupPrescriptionData()` to handle both field names
   - Now uses our helper function when grouping by region
   - Fixed the group name generation to properly handle the region case

## Files Modified

- `src/types/prescription.ts`: Updated type definitions
- `src/lib/prescriptionDataGenerator.ts`: Added helper function and updated data handling
- `src/components/campaigns/ScriptLiftComparison.tsx`: Updated imports and data handling
- `src/lib/prescriptionDataFixer.ts`: Updated imports

## Testing Approach

To verify the fixes:
1. Ensure campaigns can be created properly
2. Verify that the ScriptLiftComparison component loads without errors 
3. Check that region-based grouping works correctly in analytics
4. Verify that prescription data is properly displayed regardless of which database column contains the data

## Future Considerations

While these changes ensure compatibility with both column names, a future database migration could consolidate to a single column once all code consistently uses our helper function. This would simplify the database schema without breaking application functionality.
