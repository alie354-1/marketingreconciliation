# Campaign Status Updates: In Progress Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the "in_progress" status for new campaigns. Previously, newly created campaigns defaulted to "draft" status. Now, they will be created with "in_progress" status to better reflect the state of campaigns that are being actively worked on.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/index.ts`)

- Added 'in_progress' to the Campaign interface's status type:
  ```typescript
  status: 'draft' | 'in_progress' | 'pending' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'paused';
  ```

### 2. UI Component (`src/components/ui/CampaignCard.tsx`)

- Updated the `CampaignCardProps` interface to include the new status
- Added styling for 'in_progress' status using amber/orange colors:
  ```typescript
  const statusColor = {
    active: 'border-l-success-500',
    draft: 'border-l-gray-400',
    in_progress: 'border-l-amber-500',
    ended: 'border-l-gray-500',
    paused: 'border-l-warning-500',
    completed: 'border-l-gray-500',
    pending: 'border-l-blue-400',
  };
  ```
- Added conditional rendering to display "in progress" (with a space) as the visible status text
- Updated status badge styling:
  ```typescript
  status === 'in_progress' ? "bg-amber-100 text-amber-700" : // New amber styling
  ```

### 3. Campaign Creation (`src/components/campaigns/CampaignCreator.tsx`)

- Changed the default status when creating new campaigns:
  ```typescript
  const campaignData: any = {
    name: targeting.name,
    status: 'in_progress', // Previously 'draft'
    // ...other properties
  };
  ```

## Visual Appearance

The "in progress" status has been styled with amber/orange colors to distinguish it from other statuses:

- Draft: Gray
- In Progress: Amber/Orange
- Active: Green
- Paused: Yellow
- Ended/Completed: Dark Gray
- Pending: Blue

## Status Lifecycle

With this change, the typical campaign lifecycle is now:

1. Created as "in progress" (previously "draft")
2. Can be updated to "active" when ready to launch
3. Can be "paused" or marked as "completed"/"ended" as needed

## Benefits

- Better reflects the actual state of campaigns that are being worked on but not yet launched
- Provides visual distinction between truly inactive drafts and campaigns in progress
- Improves campaign status tracking in the dashboard

## Future Considerations

In the future, additional status workflow enhancements could include:
- Automatic status transitions based on dates
- Status-based permissions for campaign editing
- Status-specific actions and notifications
