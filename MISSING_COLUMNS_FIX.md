# Missing Columns Fix

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the database schema mismatch issues that were preventing the application from starting properly.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing `name` column in medications table**
   - Error: `column medications.name does not exist`
   - Fixed by adding the `name` column to the medications table in migration `20250330990000_add_missing_columns_for_campaign_results.sql`
   - Existing records are updated with a default name based on their ID

2. **Missing `geographic_area` column in providers table**
   - Error: `column providers.geographic_area does not exist`
   - Fixed by adding the `geographic_area` column to the providers table in migration `20250330990000_add_missing_columns_for_campaign_results.sql`
   - Values from the existing `region` column are copied to the new `geographic_area` column for consistency

3. **Campaign Results Screen Blank**
   - Fixed by ensuring the `campaign_results` table exists with the proper structure
   - Added sample data to populate the campaign results for testing
   - Created the `script_lift_data` table needed by the ScriptLiftComparison component

4. **Campaign Results Expansion Blank**
   - Fixed the issue where clicking "Full Results" in the campaign card showed a blank screen
   - Added more comprehensive historical data to the campaign_results table in migration `20250330995000_fix_campaign_results_expansion.sql`
   - Ensured the script_lift_data table has data for each campaign

## Provider Count Improvements

We've also improved how provider counts are calculated when multiple medications are selected:

1. **Updated Provider Filtering Logic**
   - Modified the provider filtering logic to increase the provider count when more medications are added
   - Changed the formula in `providerDataService.ts` from decreasing the count (`0.7 - 0.05 * medicationIds.length`) to increasing it (`0.5 + 0.1 * medicationIds.length`)
   - This ensures that adding more medications increases the potential audience rather than decreasing it

2. **Updated Fallback Calculation**
   - Modified the fallback calculation in `useTargetingForm.ts` to use the same logic of increasing provider counts with more medications
   - Changed from `baseCount * 0.7` to `baseCount * (0.5 + 0.1 * medications.length)`

3. **Added Visual Feedback**
   - Updated the `ProviderMatchSummary` component to show a tip about adding more medications when the provider count is high
   - This helps users understand that adding more medications increases their potential reach

## How to Apply the Fix

1. The migration file `20250330990000_add_missing_columns_for_campaign_results.sql` will automatically add the missing columns and create necessary tables when run
2. The code changes to `providerDataService.ts`, `useTargetingForm.ts`, and `ProviderMatchSummary.tsx` improve the provider count calculation and user experience

## Testing

After applying these fixes:

1. The ExploreDatabase component should load without errors
2. The Campaign Results screen should display data properly
3. Adding more medications in the targeting form should increase the provider count rather than decrease it
