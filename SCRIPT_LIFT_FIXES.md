# Campaign Creator and Audience Explorer Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and enhancements made to the script lift functionality and creative templates in both the Campaign Creator and Audience Explorer components.

## Overview of Changes

We've implemented several key improvements to ensure these components function properly:

### Script Lift Enhancements

1. **Added Script Lift Base Saving**: You can now save and update prescription baseline data directly from the Campaign Results screen.
2. **Connected Configuration to Data Generation**: Script lift configurations now drive the actual prescription data generation.
3. **Enhanced Diagnostics and Data Fixing**: Added tools to diagnose missing script lift data and generate it when needed.

### Creative Templates Fix

1. **Fixed 404 Error**: Addressed the issue with the creative_templates endpoint by:
   * Creating the missing `creative_templates` table in the database
   * Adding proper foreign key references and constraint handling
   * Populating template data for emails, banners, and videos
   * Ensuring backward compatibility with existing code

## How to Use Script Lift Functionality

### Viewing Script Lift Data

1. Navigate to any campaign's results page
2. Click on the "Prescription Impact" tab
3. The Script Lift Comparison component will show script lift data based on the baseline

### Saving a New Prescription Baseline

When you want to save the current prescription data as a baseline for future comparisons:

1. Go to the Campaign Results page
2. Select the "Prescription Impact" tab
3. Find the "Prescription Base Data" card
4. Click "Save Base" (or "Update Base" if a baseline already exists)
5. The system will automatically regenerate prescription data based on the configuration

### Understanding Script Lift Data

Script lift data shows the impact of your campaign on prescription volumes:

- **Target Medication**: The medication your campaign is promoting
- **Comparison Medications**: Other medications in the same class that serve as a benchmark
- **Script Lift Percentage**: The percent increase in prescriptions for your target medication compared to the baseline period

## Technical Implementation

The fixes include several key technical improvements:

1. **Non-Destructive Diagnostics**: Use `diagnoseAllCampaignsScriptLift()` to check the state of script lift data without making changes.

2. **Data Generation with Configuration**: The prescription data generator now uses script lift configurations when available:
   ```typescript
   // Example using configurations for data generation
   const scriptLiftConfig = getScriptLiftConfig(campaignId);
   if (scriptLiftConfig) {
     targetLiftPercentage = scriptLiftConfig.medications.find(m => m.isTargeted)?.liftPercentage || 15;
   }
   ```

3. **Automatic Prescription Data Regeneration**: When saving a script lift base, the system now regenerates prescription data:
   ```typescript
   // After saving configuration
   await regeneratePrescriptionData(campaignId);
   ```

4. **Data Fixing Utilities**: If you encounter campaigns missing script lift data, you can use the `generateMissingPrescriptionData()` function.

## Data Flow

The script lift data flow has been enhanced to ensure proper connections:

1. **Configuration Storage**: Script lift configurations are stored in localStorage
2. **Base Prescription Data**: Generated when campaigns become active or when configurations are updated
3. **Visualization**: The ScriptLiftComparison component displays data from the prescriptions table, using the configuration for context

## Creative Templates Implementation

The 404 error for creative templates was fixed by implementing the following:

1. **Database Schema Fixes**:
   - Created the missing `creative_templates` table with proper columns
   - Added relationships to campaigns and targeting criteria
   - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection

2. **Migration Approach**:
   - Used idempotent SQL migrations that can be run multiple times safely
   - Added early exit logic to prevent duplicate data generation
   - Created proper foreign key relationships with existing tables

3. **Template Data Population**:
   - Added sample creative templates for different channels (email, banner, video)
   - Included metadata fields for targeting and personalization
   - Created sample content that matches the expected schemas in the application

4. **Application Integration**:
   - The fix is transparent to the application code - no frontend changes required
   - All existing references to `creative_templates` now work properly
   - Both Campaign Creator and Audience Explorer can now access templates

## Migration Order

To apply all fixes (including both script lift and creative templates), the SQL migrations should be run in this order:

1. `20250330000100_sample_campaign_data.sql` - Base campaign data
2. `20250330000200_provider_generation.sql` - Provider information
3. `20250330000300_prescription_data_generation.sql` - Prescription records
4. `20250330000500_creative_templates_data.sql` - Creative templates

## Future Enhancements

Potential next steps for further improvement:

1. Add server-side storage for script lift configurations
2. Implement date-range selection for script lift period comparisons
3. Add notifications when script lift reaches significant milestones
4. Expand creative templates with more formats and personalization options
