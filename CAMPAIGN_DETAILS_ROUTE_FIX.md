# Campaign Details Route Fix

This document outlines the fix implemented to address the issue where clicking on "Full Details" in the campaign card did not display any content.

## Issue

When clicking on the "Full Details" button in the ExpandableCampaignCard component, the application would navigate to `/campaigns/:id`, but no content would appear because there was no route defined for this path in the application's routing configuration.

## Fix

The fix involved adding a new route in the `App.tsx` file to handle the `/campaigns/:id` path. This route now uses the existing `CampaignResults` component to display the campaign details.

### Changes Made

1. Added a new route in `App.tsx`:
   ```jsx
   <Route path="/campaigns/:id" element={<CampaignResults />} />
   ```

2. The `CampaignResults` component was already designed to fetch and display campaign details based on the ID parameter from the URL, so no changes were needed to this component.

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Navigate to the campaigns list page
2. Click on a campaign card to expand it
3. Click on the "Full Details" button
4. Verify that the campaign details page loads correctly, showing the same information as the "View Results" button

## Technical Details

The `ExpandableCampaignCard` component uses React Router's `Link` component to navigate to the campaign details page:

```jsx
<Link to={`/campaigns/${id}`}>
  <Button 
    variant="outline" 
    size="sm"
    leftIcon={<ExternalLink className="h-4 w-4" />}
  >
    Full Details
  </Button>
</Link>
```

The `CampaignResults` component uses the `useParams` hook from React Router to extract the campaign ID from the URL:

```jsx
const { id } = useParams<{ id: string }>();
```

It then uses this ID to fetch the campaign details and display them.
